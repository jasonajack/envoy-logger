# Information about your specific Envoy instance.
# https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com will report the serial number under the "IQ-Gateway" information
envoy:
  serial: 123456789012
  url: https://envoy.local

  # Give your envoy a name.
  # All points logged will be tagged with "source=<tag>"
  # Useful if you have multiple envoys
  tag: power-meter

# How to access InfluxDB
influxdb:
  url: http://localhost:8086
  token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

  # Which InfluxDB bucket to send measurements.
  # This can be useful to control different data-retention rules
  # alternatively use the "bucket" key if you want everything to be sent to the
  # same bucket
  bucket_hr: high_rate
  bucket_lr: low_rate
  # bucket: all_data

# Since the Envoy only tracks panel-level inverter production by serial number,
# it can be useful to provide InfluxDB measurements with additional tags that
# further describe your panels. This is completely optional, but can be useful
# metadata for your dashboard.
# You can figure out which inverter is which by logging into https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/
# and viewing: https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/pv/systems/<account number>/array_layout_x.json
# This will contain the X/Y coordinates of each inverter/panel.
# Since my layout is pretty simple, I chose to tag them with simple row/column numbers.
# Up to you to define a labeling scheme that works for you.
